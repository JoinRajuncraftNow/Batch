#SEVEN PEOPLE, MORE CHANCE OF IT BEING RAULSTON
$ I don't know Raulston. I might but just not by name. Anyway, I fixed charge, stun, and dodge. 
#Raulston is the district Techy, a.k.a. the a** that blocked batch and exe and etc.
#Yeah, that awful (though cool man)
$ Googled him. Apperently on an unnamed year, he makes $69,500.
