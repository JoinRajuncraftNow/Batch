$ Do you guys know how I can make a "global variable" that all functions can access so I don't have to worry about all of the ints with all of these functions.
# In C++?
#You put it at the top, like this

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int whatever;
void mutate()
{
  whatever = 3;
}
int main()
{
  whatever = 0;
  mutate();
  cout << whatever << endl;
  return 0;
}
