#Yeah, but multidimensional arrays are much easier to read!
#And I hate the fact that you got the jQuery sign! It's not a valid C++ variable name, only Java and JS!
$ Example:
int array [5] [5]; //5x5 area. Lets just say they all equal 0 right now.
int x=0, y=0; 
array[x][y] = 1; //Where the player is now.
(player moves east) 
array[x][y] = 0; //The function that would run if the player moves east.
x++; 
$ This would just be to keep track of the player sorta thing. 1 is where they are, 0 is where they aren't. 
$ Don't judge on my syntax. I didn't look up any details. 
$ This is what I had in mind.
#Don't worry, that syntax is valid other than the parens, watch out for the fact that int var[2][3] has member var[2][3], not var[3][2]. Keep track of the player position with a one dimensional array, so you don't have to search through the entire array for a 1.
$ Well, this isn't what I was gonna actually use it like. I was just trying to think of a quick example. Again, I know I can do everything with a 1D array, but I want to try out multi-dimensional arrays. 
# Well, if you have obstacles/things that the player can run into, then use multidimensional arrays, if you have the obstacles all be the same, to keep track of **things**, not just a single thing
