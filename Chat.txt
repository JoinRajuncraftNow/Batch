# PY IS COMMAND LINE BASED, SO IMMEDIATE (it acts as a calculator)
# And you can have powershell do the exact same thing. (just use .\mingw.exe ... when you are in the directory of mingw)
# So mingw can work with powershell!!!
$ K Thanks.
# We should get Connor Barker and Garrett Smith on GitHub (good at C++ and JavaScript, respectively)
$ Connor is not interested. I am starting on my maryville matters, to make a text adventure with C++. XD
# Some third person found our files (gulp)
# Well, I found Garrett Smith on github (he had one before both of us)
$ What. Oh ok.
$ I only made a github account for robotics, and I don't even use it for that. We only post things through the account on the robotics computer.
# Well, please add Garrett Smith as a collaborator
# And I am starting on my LONG AWAITED PROJECT, a MATHEMATICS BASED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!!!!!!!!!
$ Kewl
# Okay, thanks for adding Garrett Smith.
