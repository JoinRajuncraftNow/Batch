$ Do you guys know how I can make a "global variable" that all functions can access so I don't have to worry about all of the ints with all of these functions.
# In C++?
#You put it at the top, like this

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int whatever;
void mutate()
{
  whatever = 3;
}
int main()
{
  whatever = 0;
  mutate();
  cout << whatever << endl;
  return 0;
}
$ Thanks, there was nothing in any tutorials I could find. I figured there had to be a simple way to do it. Are there any limits or anything on this? Can it be used for chars and such too?
# (STOP STEALING MY SIGIL!), Yes, you can use it for any type of variable. But there is a limitation: I don't think you can assign to those variables, you have to do that in the main function!
