1. Inventory and Item damage system.
2. Improved UI.
3. More in-depth combat (any tips?)
4. Day/Night Cycle
5. Time-based combat(will be an option for extra challenge)
  - We will need extra threads, and timing, should'nt we just port it to python or something for this?
  - Nah, I mean time as in day/night... Sorry if it is confusing. Really should have just said add day/night features or something.
6. Options Screen
Hopefully Finished: 7. Saving/loading games
(Next) 8. A main menu
 9. (maybe) A storyline.
10. (In the very far future) an infinite world mode.
Done: 11. Random events that give quests. 
12. Spell system.

THIS IS NOT C++, GET OUT OF HERE!
